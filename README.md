Code written during basics of programming course (podstawy programowania) at the university.

Everything is in Polish :/

Commit history looks like that because this is my first ever repo and I knew nothing about that. 
I created it loooong time ago, but only locally. 
After 2 years I found this repo and made it public on github.
